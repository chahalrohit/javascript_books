// As in Java and C++ (and unlike Python which follows many centuries of
// mathematical experience), n % 2 is -1 if n is a negative integer. Explore the
// behavior of the % operator for negative operands. Analyze integers and
// floating-point numbers.

let num = -11;
let result = num % 2;

console.log("result : ", result);
